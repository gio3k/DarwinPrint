# Supported Printers
At the moment DarwinPrint only supports a small subset of printers. ⚠️ \
As DarwinPrint uses [usbselfserial](https://github.com/lotuspar/usbselfserial) to connect to printers, we are limited to the serial devices it supports. As of writing, these are printers confirmed to work:

 - Ender 3 v4.2.7, v4.2.2
 - Anycubic Vyper
 - Printers with a CH340 / CH341 serial chip
 - Printers with CDC ACM serial
