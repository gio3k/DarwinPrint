thanks to all the developers of these dependencies!
although they aren't really part of DarwinPrint (most of these are used in Klipper / OctoPrint), they are an important part of getting them to work

argparse is downloaded during the install so theres no proper credit for that, so here it is! thanks argparse (Argument Parser for Modern C++)

babel is used for OctoPrint: thanks!
netifaces is used for OctoPrint: thanks!
pyserial is used for BOTH: thanks!
can-utils-osx is used for Klipper: thanks!

klipper and octoprint are both obviously very important too, so thanks to the developers of those!
